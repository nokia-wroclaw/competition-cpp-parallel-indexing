Parallel Indexing Cpp Competition
July 2014
Kacper Kokoszka, Bartosz Szurgot

Task:
Implementation of collection with simple API:
- search(word) returns list of files containing provided word
- index(files_list) - places new files in collection.
- handle n searching and m indexing clients.

Target:
- fast access to collection
- multithread safety
- high responsiveness (no unnecessary blocking)

Tools:
- C++ 14 (gcc-4.9; clang-3.4)
- large text files available at location: unknown for now
- full C++14 (ok, ok - C++1y) is at your disposal
- no external libraries are allowed

File format:
- text files
- one word per line
- line endings format is not specified

Testing:
- 60 seconds of pseudo random search and index queries.
- the best result out of 10 runs is taken.

Winning criteria:
Sum of number of handled (finished) queries, performed by all clients + total
number of files found, by queries.

Allowed modifications:
- everything under Impl/ directory (both creating new files and modifying existing ones).
- CMakeLists.txt: adding new files, extending compilation and linking flags.
- Impl/* contains example implementation (terrible performance, but working).

Additional info:
- there are 8 readers and 2 writers threads

How to:
- run cmake: in build dir 'cmake <path_to_cmakelist.txt> [-G Ninja]' (you can try ninja instead of make)
- word_list_generator
    + <seed> - seed for generator
    + <number_of_outputs> - amount of in_files for benchmark
    + <words_per_file> - amount of words in each in_file
    + <in_file_1> ... <in_file_N> - dictionaries to generate in_files from
    + example call: ./word_list_generator 60 20 1000 ../simple_test_data/pl_10k.txt (you have much bigger dictionaries at location provided in Tools section)
- benchmark
    + <query-file> - query file generated by word_list_generator named 'queries.txt'
    + <benchmark-seconds> - testing period
    + <in-file-1> ... <in-file-N> in_files generated by word_list_generator named dict_[number].txt
    + example call: ./benchmark queries.txt 10 dict_*
